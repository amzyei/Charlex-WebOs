# About Charlex WebOS

Charlex WebOS is a web-based simulation of a real operating system. It is easy to use and looks like a real OS. The main program is written in Python files like `app.py` and `window_manager.py`.

## Project overview

Charlex WebOS is a web-based simulation that looks and works like a real operating system. It gives an easy and nice interface like a normal OS.

- **Source files:** The main code is in `app.py` and `window_manager.py`. They handle the main functions and window management.
- **Templates:** The `templates/` directory has HTML files for the user interface.
- **Static files:** The `static/` directory has images, styles, and scripts.
- **Virtual environment:** The `venv/` directory keeps the Python environment separate.
- **Version control:** The `.git/` directory tracks changes and helps teamwork.

This structure makes it easy to add new features and for people to help.
